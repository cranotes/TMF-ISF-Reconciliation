# TMF-ISF-Reconciliation

```
Investigative sites collect Essential Documents and other documents in paper form 
in a regulatory binder and/or in electronic form in an investigative site file (ISF).

Sponsor have an TMF system and a site have an ISF system.

TMF is the story book of the Sponsor while the ISF is the story book of the Investigative site.

It is import that both systems match in their contents and we achieve this by ETF/ISF reconciliation.
